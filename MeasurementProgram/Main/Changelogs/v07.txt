- Integrated Spin Coater class for easier handling
- Abort now aborts spin coater and measurement
- Acceleration now available for spin coater (value of 0 means instant acceleration)
- Spin Program changed to 1D array with cluster of Speed, Time and Acceleration for easier handling (transfer to Arduino still 2D array)
- Time in program still in seconds, but is now transfered in milliseconds to allow fast speed ups in acceleration
- Saves now in the comments-file correct frames
- frames are removed from GetDeviceInformation of spectrometer
- saves now also the program, the start to spin coating and time after spin coating in comments
