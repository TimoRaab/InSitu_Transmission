Bugfix that spectra don't include wavelength data
	So far wavelength data of in-situ could be used, but with cropping no cropping of spectra took place
	Now spectra has own wavelength data every time, new input script necessary

	Bugfix that now also when measurements are taken after in-situ wavelenght is included (not cropped)
	temp field for time calculation "x-y" is now invisible and not active anymore
